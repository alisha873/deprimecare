            <p>Déprimécare aims to provide mental health support to the student community all across India by providing a platform to reach out to well-trained and qualified mental health professionals as well as counsellors from their very own colleges while also maintaining an anonymous front to protect their identity.</p>
            <p>This helps in creating a safe place where students can open up and seek help and support without the fear of being looked at in a negative way. The site connects students to mental health professionals and makes available their profiles so students can choose a professional they feel suits their needs and personal comfort level.</p>
            <p>The other feature provided is the counsellor connect, which allows students to connect with the counsellors of their very own colleges, thus providing them with a sense of safety, knowing that they have the option to reach out to somebody around them. With the goal of creating a safe community which brings together students and counsellors, Déprimécare is here to render care to all those who need it with the hope of growing and improving with the community.</p>
